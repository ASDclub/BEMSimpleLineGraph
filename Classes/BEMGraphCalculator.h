/** Makes calculations given for a specific graph object. 
 @discussion Supply a graph object to the calculator to perform operations with that graph's data. Calculations may include the following:  
   - Average value of points
   - Sum of points  
   - Median of points  
   - Mode of points  
   - Graph standard deviation  
   - Minimum point value on graph  
   - Maximum point value on graph  
 More complex operations in the realm of calculus (including differentiation and integral calculation) may be added in a future update. */
